# URL concerns
# We'd prefer external since it's supposedly better for SEO, but
# external links targeting the real site will continue to do so when doing local development
# which means we'd need to toggle this all the time.
# Plus, atm, we don't have the redirect set up to www from the no-subdomain site,
# meaning there's a CORS error for using the font.
# So absolute is the cheap solution until we can sink a little more time into this.
# url_style = external
url_style = absolute
