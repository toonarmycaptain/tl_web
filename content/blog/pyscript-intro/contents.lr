# This intro needs work

When working with the frontend, logic is written in Javascript. However, most kids, and a lot of backend engineers learn and use python as their primary language. This, coupled with machine learning and datascience being dominated by python, now we can bring a frontend logic alternative using PyScript. 

Fear js no more - PyScript is here. 


PyScript is a framework that allows python code to run in the browser with near-native speed.

This is a accomplished with a toolchain of Pyodide-Emscripten-WASM. Pyodide takes CPython, adds an interfact between python and Typecript/JavaScript, and using Emscripten compiles it down to WASM (WebAssembly). WASM binaries executes at near-native speed and is supported by all major browsers. 


With PyScript we can:
    - run python in the browser
    - import stdlib, PyPI, and user-authored dependencies. 
    - interact with JavaScript/DOM and browser APIs

To use PyScript you just add these lines to your HTML:
# include graphic with <html><head> tags    
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
<script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>



PyScript defines several custom HTML tags:

<py-script> - this is where you type your Python code!

# example graphic

You can specify dependencies from PyPI or your own code:

# graphic:
<py-env>
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - pytorch
  - pyparsing
  </py-env>
  
  Yes, numpy, pandas, matplotlib are all pre-compiled for WASM(get details), so none of the portability issues often experienced with data libraries with a lot of C code exist: it compiles to WASM and runs at near-native speed. 
  
 You can specify your own files too:
 
 # graphic
<py-env>
  - matplotlib
  - paths:
      - my_code.py
      - my_data.csv
      - plot_background.jpg
</py-env>
  
<py-script>
from my_code import my_algorithm

with open('my_data.csv') as f:
    data = f.readlines()

output = my_algorithm(data)

# code plotting with matplotlib with plot_background.jpg  
matplotlib.blah(output, 'plot_background.jpg')
  
# write to html div
#code that writes output to html div div = Element(whatever) \ div.output(something)
</py-script>

# whatever <div> etc is needed for pyscript to output


Yep, you can pull your own code along for the ride and import it inside your <py-script> tags. You can actually bundle files of any type and use them in your code.
We can also see here how you can output from code to the browser # detail through an xyz
 [find out how these are loaded to the client, does pyscript make server calls when they're needed, or are they automatically loaded like other assets as the page loads, what's the methodology there?]
 
 
 
py-repl

Pyscript also comes with a built-in repl tag:

# side by side graphic with basic py-repl> tag/ouput div with a visual of the repl.



There are also the py-button and py-inputbox widgets that alow you to call python code from click and keypress events respectively, and PyBox, a container object that can define how it's elements are arranged and displayed Ã  CSS Flexbox. 


What does this mean, aside from being able to write Python instead of JavaScript on the frontend?


Despite warnings (link) that PyScript is "very alpha" and changes should be expected, the possibilities it enables have the potential for it to prove one of the most pivotal developments of the decade in frontend development, and web development generally.

Python has always had portability and GUI challenges. PyScript offers both a GUI for Python that is both portable wherever there is a web browser and leverages existing frontend technologies with the extensibility of Python's power as a glue between tools. 
In addition to GUI, PyScript in the browser is a single target platform for Python developers to deliver native cross-platform applications, even offering the prospect of relatively trivial mobile develoment, by wrapping PyScript based web applications with mobile-native lanaguages, (similar to what Electron has done for JavaScript?). 

This ability to offer native cross-platform experiences with Python frees ML and Datascience developers to ship their computation-heavy applications off servers and in to client devices. Got an application that runs on sensitive data that clients would rather keep on their machines? Ship the application with PyScript, and clients can leverage your application without their data ever leaving their machine. 
Any code that can run on a client, but generally doesn't because of installation/dependency issues, can be clientside with PyScript. Numpy is infamous for being difficult to install, but it's already compiled for WASM everywhere. Any tools or code that can be compiled to WASM that Python can hook into can be leveraged together, client-side. As (link) Peter Wang demonstrated at PyCon, motion-control married with software emulation married with GUI can be delivered in-browser.
Even with large packages, browser-nativity shines, as caching can preserve these resources in the client, handily also enabling offline utility.
